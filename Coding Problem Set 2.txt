## Bus-ridership analysis

 

# Sampling space for leaving the bus
s1 = c(1, 0) # 1 corresponds to leaving the bus
p1 = c(0.2, 0.8)

 

# Sampling space for boarding the bus
s2 = c(0, 1, 2)
p2 = c(0.5, 0.4, 0.1)

 

# Simulate the number of passengers from stop-1 to stop-10
nstops = 10 # number of stops
npassengers = 0 # number of passengers in the bus initially

 

# User-defined function for simulating one trial of the bus ride
# through all the stops
simTrial = function(nstops){
npassengers = 0
# Run through every stop
for (j in 1:nstops){
  # If we have at least one passenger in the bus
  # Simulate the leaving process
  if (npassengers > 0){
    left = sample(s1, size = 1, replace = FALSE, prob = p1)
    npassengers = npassengers - left
  }
  # Else if no passengers on the bus, then nobody leaves the bus
  else if (npassengers == 0){
    left = 0
  }
  # Simulate the boarding process
  boarded = sample(s2, size = 1, replace = FALSE, prob = p2)
  npassengers = npassengers + boarded
  # Print the status at every stop
  cat(sprintf('No. of passengers after stop-%d is %d (left = %d, boarded = %d)\n', j, npassengers, left, boarded))
}
return(npassengers)
}

nsimulations = 10e3
simulatedData = replicate(nsimulations, simTrial(nstops))
mean(simulatedData)
percent_people = mean(simulatedData)*100

I got the output as 4.45 sir....

I would like to conclude that mean there are at least 4 people in the bus after the 10th stop.

Like the bus is not empty throught out, since there are average of 4 people in every stop, so we can conclude that there will be at least 4 people in all the stops even after the 10th stop, hence bus will never be empty.
