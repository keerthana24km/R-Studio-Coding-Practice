## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
s_appointment = c(0,1)

p_morning = 0.3
p_afternoon = 0.6
p_appointment = matrix(nrow = 2, ncol = 2, c(1-p_morning, p_morning, 1-p_afternoon, p_afternoon), byrow = TRUE)

s_software = c(0,1)

p_software = c(0.5, 0.5)

salesResult = function(){
  result = numeric(2)
  
  for (j in c(1:2)){
    result[j] = sample(s_appointment, size = 1, prob = p_appointment[j,])
  }
  earnings = ifelse(result[1] == 0, sample(s_software, size = 1, prob = p_software), 0) +
    ifelse(result[1] == 1, sample(s_software, size = 1, prob = p_software), 0)
  return(earnings)
}

nsims = 1e5
simdata = replicate(nsims, salesResult())
#print(simdata)


mean(simdata)
```
```{r}
count = 0

checkEvent = function(data){
  if(data==5000) count=1
  return(count)
}
```
